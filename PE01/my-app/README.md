# Input
The program does not need user input. All the input is inside `Resume.js`. The styling for the page is in `Resume.css`.

# Process
By running the web app, `App.js` will import `Resume` from `Resume.js` and put it inside the main App. `Resume.js` structures the content using HTML-like JSX elements, while `Resume.css` applies specific styles to those elements.

# Output
The final output is a  resume that shows in the browser. It has a bright background color (`#bdfb04`), black text, and consistent margins and fonts that match the requirements.
